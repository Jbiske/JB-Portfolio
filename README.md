# challenge2 Notes
The file shows what i have started with my portifolio including an about me. Places to put future projects and links to them when i have them and a contact me page which is not fully operational.
I have a lot of bugs and things I really want to work out. I plan on resubmitting when I get more time later this week.
I really enjoyed this challenge but it was challenging for me because design aspect is tricky.
